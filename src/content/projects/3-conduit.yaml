description: "<a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld'>Conduit</a> is actually an API specification of a Medium clone. This is the back-end app of that spec but built with <a target='_blank', href='https://graphql.org'>GraphQL</a> and <a target='_blank', href='https://nestjs.com'>NestJS</a>. I tried to adhere to the specification as much as possible but since the spec is based on a RESTful architecture, I had to naturally change a few things. I used PostgreSQL for the database. The codebase also has 100% test coverage.

Authenticated users also get a nice personalized feed filled with articles of the authors that they follow and the results can be paginated. I have yet to put together a front-end for this one as the back-end was a lot of work as is."
