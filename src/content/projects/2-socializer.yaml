name: "Socializer"
description: "Socializer, as the name suggests, is a social media app built with Firebase and React. It was designed with a mobile first approach. Users (also called as socializers), share what's going on in their lives through text centric posts. The text content itself can exceed 1000+ characters. Other socializers can comment on them and these comments in turn can be replied to as well.
<br /> <br />
Functionality that you would expect from most social media apps is included."
